# ROMS simulation settings (compile-time)
While most settings in ROMS are controlled at runtime via a namelist file (see corresponding doc page), CPP macros are used to include or exclude large blocks of code at compile time, effectively acting as switches for features of the model. These are controlled in the `cppdefs.opt` (enabled with `#define <CPPKEY>` or disabled with `#undef <CPPKEY>`), which should be placed alongside the `Makefile` in the directory where the ROMS executable is being compiled.

An example of this file is provided at `$ROMS_ROOT/src/cppdefs.opt`.

This page contains a description of all the settings in the `cppdefs.opt` file. Each section of the file gets a section of the page below including a table of switches described in that section. For each switch, the table indicates whether it is enabledd or disabledd in the default configuration.
